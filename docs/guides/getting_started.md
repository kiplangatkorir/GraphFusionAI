### Repository Overview

The GraphFusion Core repository consists of key components such as:
- **Graph Management**: Core graph representation and optimization.
- **Neural Memory System**: Efficient memory management, persistence, and confidence scoring.
- **Distributed Processing**: Support for multi-agent memory sharing.
- **Utilities and Helpers**: Logging, metrics, and utility functions for smooth development and debugging.

For a more in-depth look at the structure, please refer to the `architecture.md` file in the `docs/internal/` folder.

### Prerequisites

To run GraphFusion, you will need the following tools:
- **Python 3.9 or higher**
- **Poetry**: For dependency management and virtual environment setup.
- **Git**: To clone and manage code versions.

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:graphfusion/graphfusion-core.git
   cd graphfusion-core
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   GraphFusion uses Poetry to manage dependencies. Run the following commands to install Poetry and set up your environment:
   ```bash
   # Install Poetry (if not already installed)
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

   # Install dependencies
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Activate the Environment**:
   Once dependencies are installed, activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

### Running the Code

To get a feel for GraphFusionâ€™s functionalities, you can run the example scripts provided in the `examples/` directory.

1. **Basic Usage**:
   ```bash
   python examples/basic_usage.py
   ```
   This script demonstrates basic graph and memory operations within the core GraphFusion framework.

2. **Advanced Features**:
   ```bash
   python examples/advanced_features.py
   ```
   Explore advanced functionalities like memory consolidation, confidence scoring, and data processing.

3. **Benchmarking**:
   For testing performance, run:
   ```bash
   python examples/benchmarks.py
   ```

### Testing and Linting

GraphFusion uses `pytest` for testing and `flake8` for linting to ensure code quality.

1. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   ```
   This command will execute all unit, integration, and performance tests located in the `tests/` directory.

2. **Run Linting**:
   ```bash
   poetry run flake8 src
   ```
   This will check for style issues across the codebase. You can also use `black` to format your code automatically:
   ```bash
   poetry run black src
   ```

### Contributing

1. **Fork the Repository** and create a new branch for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   ```
2. **Make Your Changes** and ensure all tests pass.
3. **Submit a Pull Request** following the template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
