# GraphFusion Core

GraphFusion Core is the foundational engine for GraphFusion, an advanced AI platform designed to manage neural memory networks. GraphFusion Core focuses on building a highly scalable, persistent, and queryable memory system with real-time learning and adaptive confidence scoring. The core includes features like memory persistence, data fusion, confidence scoring, and a self-healing mechanism to enable reliable and intelligent memory systems.

## Features

- **Graph Representation**: Efficient, scalable graph structure for neural memory networks.
- **Memory Management**: Persistent memory with caching and data lifecycle control.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Real-time assessment and scoring of data accuracy.
- **Data Fusion**: Combines new data with existing memory structures to support real-time learning.
- **Self-Healing Mechanism**: Detects and corrects inconsistencies autonomously.
- **Modular Design**: Extensible components for ease of development and integration.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the GraphFusion Core for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Poetry** for dependency management

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/graphfusion/graphfusion-core.git
   cd graphfusion-core
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Use Poetry to handle dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a configuration file in the `config/` directory based on your environment. Default values can be found in `config/default.yml`.

4. **Run Tests**
   Make sure everything is set up correctly by running the tests:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   ```

### Basic Usage

Below is a simple example of how to use the core components of GraphFusion:

```python
from graphfusion.core.graph import Graph
from graphfusion.core.memory import Memory
from graphfusion.core.confidence import ConfidenceScore

# Initialize components
graph = Graph()
memory = Memory()
confidence_score = ConfidenceScore()

# Example: Adding data to the graph
data = {"node": "A", "value": 5}
graph.add_node(data)

# Storing data in memory
memory.store(data)

# Calculating confidence score
score = confidence_score.calculate(data)
print("Confidence Score:", score)
```

## Repository Structure

The repository follows a modular structure for maintainability and scalability:

```plaintext
