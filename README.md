# GraphFusionAI

GraphFusionAI is an open-source framework for building **adaptive multi-agent systems** using the power of **knowledge graphs** and **neural memory networks**. It provides a foundation for creating collaborative, real-time learning agents capable of dynamic task orchestration and semantic understanding.  

The project is designed for modularity and accessibility, enabling developers to build **graph-based AI agents** and **multi-agent systems** across industries like **healthcare**, **finance**, **education**, and more.


## Key Features

- **Graph-Based Memory**: Combines structured knowledge graphs with neural memory for adaptable and queryable agent memory.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Supports dynamic task orchestration and collaboration between AI agents.
- **Real-Time Adaptability**: Self-healing mechanisms and context-aware decision-making in dynamic environments.
- **Open-Source Focus**: Actively maintained, modular, and open for contributions to shape its evolution.
- **Integrations with LLMs**: Expandable with large language model tools for enhanced capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- Required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GraphFusion/GraphFusionAI.git
   cd GraphFusionAI
   ```

2. Install the package via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

3. Install additional dependencies for development:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Quick Start

1. Run the **Simple Agent Workflow** example:
   ```bash
   python examples/simple_agent_workflow.py
   ```
2. Review outputs to observe agent interactions, memory updates, and graph modifications.

## Contributing
