### 1. Coding Standards

- **Follow PEP 8**: Ensure code is consistent with Python's PEP 8 style guide. Use linters like `flake8` to catch any issues.
- **Use Type Hints**: Type annotations improve code readability and help with debugging and refactoring.
- **Organize Imports**: Group and order imports as follows:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Third-party libraries
  3. Local module imports
- **Keep Functions Small and Focused**: Aim for functions to do one thing well. This improves readability, testing, and maintenance.
- **Consistent Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. Follow naming conventions (e.g., snake_case for variables, CamelCase for classes).

### 2. Documentation

- **Docstrings**: Every module, class, and public function should have a clear and concise docstring describing its purpose. Use [Google Style Docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).
- **README Updates**: Keep the `README.md` up to date with any significant changes or additions to core functionalities.
- **Code Comments**: Write comments to clarify complex logic, but avoid unnecessary comments for self-explanatory code.
- **API Documentation**: Update API docs under `docs/api/` with any new functionality or modifications.

### 3. Testing

- **Write Unit Tests for New Features**: Ensure that every new feature has corresponding unit tests to validate its behavior.
- **Coverage Goal**: Aim for at least 90% test coverage across the codebase.
- **Test Naming**: Use descriptive names for test functions, e.g., `test_confidence_score_calculation()`.
- **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocking libraries to isolate the unit of code being tested.
- **Run Tests Locally**: Before pushing code, always run `pytest` locally to verify your changes.

### 4. Code Reviews

- **Review Small, Focused PRs**: Submit pull requests that are limited in scope and focused on a single feature or fix.
- **Be Clear and Constructive**: Offer specific feedback, ask questions for clarification, and suggest improvements. Avoid nit-picking over minor style issues if they don’t impact functionality or readability.
- **Automated Checks**: Ensure that all CI checks pass before approving a PR, including linting, testing, and type checking.
- **Use CODEOWNERS for Accountability**: Each module should have designated code owners who review and approve changes for that module.

### 5. Performance Optimization

- **Efficient Algorithms**: When dealing with large graph structures or memory management, consider time and space complexity. Use efficient algorithms and data structures.
- **Profiling Tools**: Use tools like `cProfile` and `memory_profiler` to analyze bottlenecks in critical code paths.
- **Caching**: Utilize caching where possible, especially in repetitive operations, to improve speed.
- **Batch Processing**: Avoid looping over single items when processing large datasets; consider batch processing for efficiency.
- **Optimize Imports**: Only import what is necessary to keep memory usage low.

### 6. Security

- **Sanitize Inputs**: Validate all external inputs to prevent injection attacks and buffer overflows.
- **Secrets Management**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys. Use environment variables or secure vaults.
- **Regular Dependency Checks**: Monitor and update dependencies regularly to patch security vulnerabilities. Review findings from security scans in the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Error Handling**: Use exception handling to catch and handle errors gracefully. Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
